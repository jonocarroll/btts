Provides an Rmd macro to insert a HTML popup bar in the help menu linking 
back to the GitHub page to encourage collaboration, report bugs, etc...

The behaviour of \code{\link[btts]{install_github}} is otherwise identical to
the devtools version \code{\link[devtools]{install_github}} except that some
HTML code is carefully inserted in the roxygen2 header. Processing of the
roxygen2 code into a .Rd \code{\link[utils]{help}} file is also hijacked and
HTML sanitisation is deactivated (for that call only). The injected HTML
(static, not user-changeable for now) overlays a pull-up tab at the bottom of
HTML help files (such as viewed in RStudio) with some context of the GitHub 
package, such as links to the source, issues page, version, and author.

The code for *that* function is linked to in the GitHub repo, meaning you can
see exactly how the function was written, rather than the comment-lacking 
body() from within R.

Noam Ross created \url{https://github.com/noamross/htmlhelp} which I adapted
into this form. This would not have been possible without his first steps.
